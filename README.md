# ParityGameLib

This repository contains ParityGameLib, an F# library for solving parity games.
Currently the library features:

- A basic datatype to maintain and manipulate parity games
- An wrapper to solve parity games using [oink](https://github.com/trolando/oink) and extract a winning positional strategy
- A direct (not optimized) implementation of Zielonka's recursive algorithm
